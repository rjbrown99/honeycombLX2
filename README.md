# SolidRun Honeycomb LX2 with RHEL 9
Reference for using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 with the Honeycomb LX2 Board.

The attached files are tested for use with kernel-5.14.0-70.17.1.el9_0.src.rpm.

- The sed line below is just tagging the kernel with a custom build ID so it's not confused with the original RHEL package. You can use whatever you like there.
- The wiki in this repo has the specific kernel options that were enabled. Nothing else was changed, disabled, or adjusted from the RHEL9 default. 

### Kernel Build Process
```
yum install yum-utils
yumdownloader --source kernel (downloads kernel src RPM from RedHat)
rpm -Uvh kernel-5.14.0-70.17.1.el9_0.src.rpm
cp kernel-aarch64-rhel.config ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
cp kernel-local ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES
sed 's/# define buildid .local/%define buildid .honeycomb/g' -i ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/kernel.spec
rpmbuild -bb --with baseonly --without debuginfo kernel.spec
```
